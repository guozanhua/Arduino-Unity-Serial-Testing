# API MODE

## Premise
A basic example of sending data from multiple **senders** to one **receiver**, and printing that data out to **Serial**.

### Sender
Sends packets to the address of the **receiver**

### Receiver 
Listens for packets, and then prints them to **serial**

## Resources
### Software
- [Arduino IDE] (http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
- [API mode for Arduino] (https://code.google.com/p/xbee-arduino/)
- [XCTU] (http://www.digi.com/support/productdetail?pid=3352&type=utilities)

### Hardware
- [Arduino UNO] (http://arduino.cc/en/main/arduinoBoardUno)
- [Wireless Shield] (http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoXbeeShield)
- [XBee Series 1 Chip] (http://www.digi.com/products/wireless-wired-embedded-solutions/zigbee-rf-modules/point-multipoint-rfmodules/xbee-series1-module#overview)

## Setup
### Hardware Configuration
Each Xbee is set to **API mode** with a **DH** of 0, and **DL** of FFFF.  The **MY** of the receiver is set to 0.  The other **MY**'s are set arbitrarily (1-4 in my case).

XCTU was used to program the XBee radio modules.

### Software Installation
The Arduino code must be uploaded with the shield's *jumper pins* set to **USB**.  Then to transmit, set the *jumper pins* back to **XBEE**.
